## Inspiration
The Blue Star Mothers of America is a national nonprofit organization that provides support and assistance to active-duty service members, veterans, and their families. 

Blue Star Mothers chapters actively support military personnel and their families through initiatives like sending care packages to deployed troops, community outreach programs, and advocacy for veterans' issues.

However, the substantial manual effort involved in these processes limits their capacity, leading to infrequent packing parties, with at most two occurrences per year.

## Our Solution
To solve this problem,  we have formed a system which helps take all the necessary information from the members and their requests to help generate a form automatically without almost no manual work!

Through the implementation of this automation, we will optimize the packaging process to the extent that it nears instantaneous completion, substantially diminishing the requirement for manual labor within Blue Star Mothers of America Inc. 

Consequently, the organization will now have the capacity to expedite the delivery of more packages in less time while relieving workers of excessive manual input.
