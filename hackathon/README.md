## Inspiration
The Blue Star Mothers of America is a national nonprofit organization that provides support and assistance to active-duty service members, veterans, and their families. 

Blue Star Mothers chapters actively support military personnel and their families through initiatives like sending care packages to deployed troops, community outreach programs, and advocacy for veterans' issues.

However, the substantial manual effort involved in these processes limits their capacity, leading to infrequent packing parties, with at most two occurrences per year.

## Our Solution
To solve this problem,  we have formed a system which helps take all the necessary information from the members and their requests to help generate a form automatically without almost no manual work!

Through the implementation of this automation, we will optimize the packaging process to the extent that it nears instantaneous completion, substantially diminishing the requirement for manual labor within Blue Star Mothers of America Inc. 

Consequently, the organization will now have the capacity to expedite the delivery of more packages in less time while relieving workers of excessive manual input.

## How it is built
The frontend of our solution is built through
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

The backend of our solution is built through
- Docker
- Mailgun
- MongoDB
- Node.js

## Challenges
A problem we encountered was accessing the USPS API, which will allow us to upload a csv file generated from our software and create a shipping label
To avoid this issue, we utilized a different label generating software that also accepts a csv as a temporary fix.

## Accomplishments
With several members of our team entering their first hackathon, as well as having nearly no experience with web development, we are actually very proud to have worked together as a cohesive team to learn the relevant technologies and create a working webpage with an integrated backend database within the timespan of one day 

## What we learned
Some of our members learned how to create their first website with an attached backend. We also learned how to use docker, nodejs, and mongoDB in CRUD practices

## What's next
Due to time constraints, we have not been able to perfectly implement the whole idea in our project, but here is an overview of what we have planned for the project:
For further security, we are planning to implement the GPS tracking to check and verify that the person using the account is the real owner or not.
We are also planning to implement the communication platform for the family members of the members and the donors.
Automatic printing of USPS labels without any external manual labor.
